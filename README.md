# Derivations of Equations in The Elements of Statistical Learning

As I read through ESL (Second Edition), I made notes on derivations of non-trivial equations and would like to share them. The authors assigned some equations in the text as exercises, and I did not include them in my document, since their solutions are available in the solution manuals listed below.

<li> A Guide and Solution Manual to ESL by J. C. Ma </li>

I used the same mathematical notation as in ESL. However, on a few occasions I used boldface lower characters for vector notation, like when referring Wikipedia or Matrix Cookbook.
